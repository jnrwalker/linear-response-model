# linear-response-model

This notebook is an exploratory investigation of the linear response model.
𝑥!=𝜂!(𝑥!"#+𝜆𝑥$−𝑥!"# )
In particular, we investigate how varying eigenvalues changes the behaviour of this model close to a tipping point (where taking the limit of the eigenvalue approaching zero). We show that close to a tipping point, the variance and hence standard deviations increase exponentially. Furthermore we show that the linear response model exhbitis a lag-1 autocorrelation approaching 1 (ie total autocorrelation) as the eigenvalue approaches zero.
